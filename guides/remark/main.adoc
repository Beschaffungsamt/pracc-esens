== General

* CustomizationID and profileID values must be changed
* For complex elements where there is only one child element, the child element is set to mandatory
* Where there are mismatches between BII or eSens validation rules and cardinality in the model, the validation rule is used.
** Example is DocumentHash and method for Submit tender (T005)
