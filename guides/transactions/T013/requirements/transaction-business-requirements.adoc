NOTE: Please note that the transaction "{name-transaction}" has to be sent to contracting authorities when an existing tender is withdrawn. As a consequence, the "{name-transaction}" shall be also sent before sending an updated tender, to ensure that the economic operator receives confirmation of the withdrawal of the old tender, as well as a corresponding confirmation of the submission of a new tender.
