= Business process

The following diagram shows the choreography of the business process implemented by the profile. The choreography of business collaborations defines the sequence of interactions when the profile is run within its context.


[IMPORTANT]
====

The red text color in the choreography below denotes the changes compared with the original CEN/BII profile 60. On the Trdm097 Tender Status Inquiry request a Trdm083 Call for Tenders (without ESPD) is sent, whereas in the original profile the contracting authority responds with Trdm098 Tender Status.

Trdm083 Call for Tenders is part of CEN/BII profile 47 and will not be described in this document, but in BIS47x.
